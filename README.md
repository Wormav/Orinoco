# Orinoco

Fifth project of the web developer course at OpenClassrooms.

The main objective is to create the front-end of an e-commerce site in vanilla Javascript by consuming an API previously provided ( [JWDP5](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/JWDP5) ).

This is only an MVP, no real transaction management is done.

No model is given. You are asked to improvise the user interface.
